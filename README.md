# Georgia-ReBORN - A Clean foobar2000 Theme

Georgia-ReBORN is a modification of **[Mordred's original Georgia theme](https://github.com/kbuffington/Georgia)** for foobar2000.<br />
It's purpose is to be used mainly as a desktop version, the layout has been modified to look clean and simple without any distractions.
The cover artwork and playlist are the main focus.

Georgia-ReBORN has 10 themes in total ( Options -> Change Theme ):

WilB's awesome biography script has been integrated and modified. You can right click on the biography
to change various options. There are 4 different biography layouts to choose from. Top is the default.
There is also an automatic lyric fetcher using the Lyric Show 3 ( by The vern ) and Multisource component ( by veksha ).
Synched lyrics will be highlighted with a theme color, unsynched lyrics have the default white text color:

Georgia-ReBORN supports 4k resolutions and will adjust theme elements based on DPI and screen size. Fullscreen mode is also supported!
There are 6 pre-defined sizes ( Options -> Change Player Size ), 3 for FULL HD and below and 3 for 4K resolution and higher.
These pre-defined sizes are restricted, if you have a monitor capable of 1920 x 1200 and below the first 3 are available,
if you have a monitor capable of 4K resolution and higher the other 3 are available.
You can of course resize foobar to your liking, but it has minimum size restrictions ( Player Size 'Small' ) to prevent button and text overlapping.

There is also a mini compact player ala Winamp ( Options -> Change Layout Mode -> Playlist Mode ).<br />
You can resize the width and height but it also has a minimum width restriction:

**NOTE:** Georgia-ReBORN starts in player size 'Small' as a failsafe player size for small res. monitor/laptop screens<br />
and looks best if you switch to 'Normal' or a bigger player size!
